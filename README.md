# Unnamed Minecraft Protocol Snooper (UMPS)
This project aims to be a general purpose program for snooping on the Minecraft Java Edition network protocol.

**NOTE**: This project is very WIP and currently only contains some basic UI code. Come back later for actual stuff maybe.

These are the features that are intended for the future:
- Online-mode authentication with a Mojang token
- Proxy mode
- Saving/loading trace logs
- more secret features that will be implemented eventually
